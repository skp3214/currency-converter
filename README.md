## 🚀 About the Project  
This project is a React.js adaptation of the currency converter originally created by Shradha Khapra using vanilla JavaScript and the `fetch` API.  

### 🛠 Purpose  
- To understand how DOM manipulation differs in React compared to vanilla JavaScript.  
- To explore how APIs can be integrated seamlessly in React for dynamic functionality.  

### 🌍 Features  
- **Country Flags**: Dynamically fetched using an API.  
- **Currency Conversion**: Real-time exchange rates provided via API integration.
